  <p><strong>Hi, I'm Shuo Jiang.</strong> I work at the intersection of <strong>AI</strong>, <strong>engineering design</strong>, and <strong>deep-tech innovation</strong>. My research looks at how AI can support human creativity and improve design and decision-making in complex engineering problems.</p>

  <p>I completed my PhD at <strong>Shanghai Jiao Tong University</strong>, spent time at <strong>MIT</strong> as a visiting researcher, and previously worked as a Research Fellow at <strong>SUTD</strong>. I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at <strong>City University of Hong Kong</strong>.</p>

  <p>Outside academia, I co-founded <strong>DigiCodon</strong>, a DNA data storage startup in Hangzhou, where I led technical development as CTO and helped the company raise multiple rounds of venture funding.</p>
